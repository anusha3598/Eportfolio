                By designing a short animation, I bridged the gap between abstract ideas and tangible understanding, showcasing how friction impacts motion through clear and dynamic visuals. This approach aligns with modern educational practices, which emphasize interactive and multimedia tools to enhance student engagement and comprehension.

                The process of creating the animation taught me a lot about storytelling and design. I started by drafting a concise script, ensuring the content was focused and suitable for a short video. Using Adobe Animate was both exciting and challenging.

                While the software offered powerful tools for customization, it had a steep learning curve, especially when managing multiple layers and animations simultaneously. I supplemented my work with Canva for additional design elements and transitions. Canva's user-friendly interface helped me create polished slides and integrate visuals seamlessly. However, balancing the two tools presented challenges, such as ensuring consistency in style and timing.

                Recording the voiceover and syncing it with animations was another hurdle, requiring multiple adjustments to achieve smooth narration. One downside of the tools was the time investment; Adobe Animate, in particular, demanded a significant amount of time to understand and utilize effectively. Additionally, while Canva is straightforward, its animations are less customizable compared to Adobe Animate, which limited some creative possibilities.

                Despite these challenges, the project reinforced the importance of visual aids in education. The final animation not only explained friction effectively but also demonstrated how technology can make learning interactive and enjoyable. This project has inspired me to explore further ways to integrate multimedia into teaching, enhancing both engagement and understanding.
