                    By designing an animation, I bridged the gap between abstract ideas and tangible understanding, showcasing how friction impacts motion through clear and dynamic visuals.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The process aligns with modern educational practices, emphasizing interactive and multimedia tools to enhance student engagement and comprehension.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I drafted a concise script, ensuring the content was focused and suitable for a short video.

                    Using Adobe Animate was both exciting and challenging:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Designing elements like the rolling ball and simulating friction effects required attention to detail and precision.</li>
                        <li>The software offered powerful tools for customization but had a steep learning curve, especially when managing multiple layers and animations simultaneously.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    I supplemented my work with Canva for additional design elements and transitions:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Canva's user-friendly interface helped me create polished slides and integrate visuals seamlessly.</li>
                        <li>However, ensuring consistency in style and timing between Canva and Adobe Animate was a challenge.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Recording the voiceover and syncing it with animations required multiple adjustments to achieve smooth narration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Downsides of the tools:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adobe Animate demanded a significant time investment to understand and utilize effectively.</li>
                        <li>Canvaâ€™s animations were less customizable compared to Adobe Animate, limiting some creative possibilities.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Despite challenges, the project reinforced the importance of visual aids in education:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The final animation effectively explained friction.</li>
                        <li>It demonstrated how technology can make learning interactive and enjoyable.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    This project inspired me to explore further ways to integrate multimedia into teaching, enhancing both engagement and understanding.
