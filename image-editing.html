<p>PART 1<br><br>For this project, I had the exciting opportunity to design a book cover of my choice, and I selected The Devil Wears Prada by Lauren Weisberger. This novel delves into themes of ambition, personal growth, and relationships through the journey of Andrea Sachs, an assistant to the formidable Miranda Priestly at *Runway* magazine.  
I created the design using Canva, leveraging its intuitive tools to bring my vision to life. I opted for a minimalist black background with a subtle gradient, reflecting the elegance and sophistication of the fashion industry. The title, *The Devil Wears Prada*, is styled in bold red to symbolize power and intensity, while the author’s name is presented in a smaller, refined font to maintain balance.  
To emphasize the novel's widespread acclaim, I added a "#1 New York Times Bestseller" badge. The main image features a stylish woman representing Miranda Priestly, adorned with devil horns and a tail to hint at her complex and commanding nature.  The layout prioritizes a clean and balanced composition, harmonizing the title, imagery, and author’s name. Careful use of white space enhances the overall sophistication and minimalist aesthetic of the cover.  
Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the principles of design, such as the effective use of typography, imagery, and layout to convey a story. Canva’s features allowed me to experiment with gradients, layering, and alignment, further sharpening my design skills. This project was not only a creative exploration but also a lesson in balancing creativity with functionality to create a visually compelling and meaningful design.  </p>

            <p>PART 2<br><br>
                <p>I designed a logo for a café I hope to open, combining my passion for coffee and nature into a visually appealing and meaningful design. The logo features a steaming coffee cup with a blooming flower emerging from it, symbolizing growth, freshness, and the nurturing environment I envision for the café.  The color palette is carefully chosen to represent the café’s essence: earthy brown tones evoke the richness of coffee, while soft blue accents add a touch of freshness and tranquility. The name *Bloom & Brew* is styled in bold, modern typography, exuding confidence and warmth. Beneath it, "Coffee Shop" appears in a smaller, elegant font to balance the design and provide clarity.  
Using Canva as my design tool, I created the logo with basic vector shapes like circles and lines, ensuring a clean and minimalist aesthetic. This approach allows the design to remain versatile, whether it’s used on signage, menus, or merchandise.  Through this project, I learned the importance of aligning design elements with brand identity. From choosing the right color scheme to balancing typography and imagery, this experience deepened my understanding of how to create a logo that is not only visually appealing but also conveys the values and mission of a brand. It was an inspiring exercise in blending creativity and simplicity to bring my café vision to life.</p>
