            <p>PART 1<br><br>
                <p>I designed a book cover for The Devil Wears Prada, a novel that explores ambition, relationships, and personal growth through the journey of Andrea Sachs, an assistant to the powerful Miranda Priestly at Runway magazine.<br><br>
                    For the design, I chose a minimalist black background with a subtle gradient, reflecting the fashion industry’s elegance. The title, The Devil Wears Prada, is styled in bold red for power, with Lauren Weisberger’s name in a smaller, elegant font.<br><br>
                    I added a "#1 New York Times Bestseller" badge to highlight its success. The main image features a stylish woman symbolizing Miranda Priestly, with devil horns and a tail to hint at her complex nature.<br><br>
                    The layout is clean and balanced, ensuring harmony between the title, imagery, and author’s name, with enough white space to keep the design sophisticated and minimalist.</p>

            <p>PART 2<br><br>
                <p>I designed a logo for a café I hope to open, combining my love for coffee and nature. The logo features a coffee cup with a blooming flower emerging from it, symbolizing growth and freshness.<br><br>
                    The color scheme includes earthy brown tones for coffee and soft blue for freshness. The name "Bloom & Brew" is in bold, modern typography, with "Coffee Shop" beneath in a smaller font. Basic vector shapes like circles and lines were used to keep the design simple and clean.</p>
