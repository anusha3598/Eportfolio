                For my educational video assignment, I made a video on the Taj Mahal. My interest in Indian history inspired me to capture the beauty of this world wonder. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is not just a stunning piece of architecture; it’s a monument to love, history, and artistry. I used iMovie to make this video.

                Using iMovie, I employed various editing techniques to create a visually compelling and educational experience. I applied the Ken Burns effect to still images, adding subtle motion to emphasize architectural details like the central dome and floral inlays. Smooth transitions like dissolve and crossfade ensured the video maintained a seamless flow. Captions provided historical context, highlighting features such as "History" and "Tourism," while background music underscored the video’s reflective and majestic tone.
                I used dissolve and crossfade transitions to ensure smooth and natural scene changes, while the Ken Burns effect was applied to still images to enhance engagement by focusing on intricate carvings and symmetrical designs. Key text captions, such as "History" and "Tourism," provided essential context to the visuals. Ambient background music was carefully selected to complement the tone, and narration was synced seamlessly with the visuals to create an immersive experience. A formal title screen and credits were included to acknowledge resources and provide a polished conclusion. This project deepened my appreciation for historical storytelling through multimedia and allowed me to refine my video editing skills. By balancing technical precision with a passion for history and culture, I aimed to create a narrative that celebrates the Taj Mahal’s enduring legacy.
