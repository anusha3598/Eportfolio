            For my educational video assignment,I made a video on the Taj Mahal. My interest in Indian history inspired me to capture the beauty of this world wonder.This UNESCO World Heritage Site is not just a stunning piece of architecture; it’s a monument to love, history, and artistry.I used IMovies to make this video.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Using iMovie, I employed various editing techniques to create a visually compelling and educational experience. I applied the Ken Burns effect to still images, adding subtle motion to emphasize architectural details like the central dome and floral inlays. Smooth transitions like dissolve and crossfade ensured the video maintained a seamless flow. Captions provided historical context, highlighting features such as "History" and "Tourism," while background music underscored the video’s reflective and majestic tone.

Editing Process in iMovie:

Transitions: I used dissolve and crossfade transitions for smooth, natural scene changes.
Ken Burns Effect: Applied to still images to enhance engagement by focusing on intricate carvings and symmetrical designs.
Text Captions: Added key context, such as "History" and "Tourism."
Background Music & Narration: Selected ambient music to complement the tone while syncing narration with visuals for an immersive experience.
Title & Credits: Created a formal title screen and credits to acknowledge the resources used and provide a polished conclusion.
This project deepened my appreciation for historical storytelling through multimedia and allowed me to hone my video editing skills. By balancing technical precision with a passion for history and culture, I aimed to create a narrative that celebrates the Taj Mahal’s enduring legacy.</p>

            I hope you enjoy this just as much as I enjoyed making it
